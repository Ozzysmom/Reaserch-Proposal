  <h1>Research Proposal</h1>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
   <p>As someone who grew up in a bilingual household I find it very interesting to understand how learning is affected for kids. Most research links, “better academic results – this is because multilingual or bilingual children can often concentrate better, are better at solving problems, understand language structures better, and are better at multitasking.”

  <h3>Background/Review of the Literature</h3>
  <p>Many children grow up hearing and using more than one language whether this is due to parental figures or some form of international learning through a school. Researchers have estimated that the majority of the world’s population use more than one language on a regular basis. Parents, educators and legislators alike take an interest in research findings on child bilingualism in a concerted effort to ensure that bilingualism does not put children at any intellectual or emotional risk. This is something very interesting because of the classes put in place for children speaking other languages. One of the earliest concerns that researchers explored was the idea that bilingualism confused children. However, research has shown that bilingualism does not trigger confusion, has no inherent negative impact on development and, more importantly, has some significant socio-cognitive advantages. There is a large focus on the impact of bilingualism on socio-cognitive and socio-emotional development. “Socio-cognitive development refers to how children change with age in terms of their abilities to think about social and communicative issues. Socio-emotional development refers to how children change with age in terms of their processing of emotions in a social and communicative setting.”

  <h3>Rationale</h3>
  <p>The specific question I am exploring is on the effects on How growing up in a multilingual household affects learning. 
This is related to a larger issue because of claims being made such as that it may do more harm than good. 
After more research it has more so been proven that the effects of  growing up in a multilingual household are good.
While exploring the topic of bilingualism it is also interesting to explore the variables that can affect the outcome of bilingual development such as:
Context in which the languages are learned
parental attitudes toward bilingualism
the status of the language(s) in the community
the socio-cultural context in which children grow up
</p>

  <h3>Method and Design</h3>
  <p>How I collect data would be through the process of using kids growing up in a multilingual household and studying how they perform academically. This is a form of participant observation. The study would consist of multiple participants where I would regularly check in with their grades, scores, and overall academic performance. There would be no additional rules to follow. The only thing that needs to be consistent is that they need to be in a household actively speaking and practicing the language. It is not necessary to communicate with the children so much step by step as they should continue normally to go to school. What will be studied will be the results on test scores and academic performance as well as observing extracurricular activities. This method is the most appropriate form of research because it allows the researcher to get an accurate and authentic version of the participants needed to answer the research question. 
	The manipulated variables that this study will need are the different people I would be studying. This question cannot be answered with only one piece of data; I need to change the people I am observing. Changing the factors would impair my data, thus being a threshold for confirming or disconfirming my hypothesis. Depending on the data I get is how the question would be answered, so changing the manipulated variables could in fact change the overall results. The controlled variables would be that the individuals that I am observing speak a second language at home. The language is irrelevant, as long as it’s not solely english. Another controlled variable would be that the parents of the participants need to be immigrants from another country and the participants go to American institutional school. They also (participants) need to speak English natively. This design would rule out the possibility of not getting accurate data from the participants. If I study people who do not have immigrant parents, or who do not speak another language at home, then the data would not matter for the research question.
